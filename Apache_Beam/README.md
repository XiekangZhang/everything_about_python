# Apache Beam with focus on Python
## Apache Beam Overview
Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel 
processing pipelines. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beam's supported __distributed processing
back-ends__, which include _Apache Flink_, _Apache Spark_, and _Google Cloud Dataflow_.

Beam is particularly useful for embarrassingly parallel data processing tasks, in which the problem
can be decomposed into many smaller bundles of data that can be processed independently and in parallel.
You can also use Beam for Extract, Transform, and Load tasks and pure data integration.

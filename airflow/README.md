# Airflow
- Airflow is a batch workflow orchestration platform. The airflow framework contains operators to connect with many technologies and is easily extensible to connect with a new technology. If your workflows have a clear start and end, and run at regular intervals, they can be programmed as an Airflow DAG.
- If you prefer coding over clicking, Airflow is the tool for you. Workflows are defined as Python code.
- But Airflow was built for finite batch workflows. While the CLI and REST API do allow triggering workflows, Airflow was not built for infinitely running event-based workflows. --> Airflow is not a streaming solution.
